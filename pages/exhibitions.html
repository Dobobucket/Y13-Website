                Taking our artworks to exhibitions has been a wonderful way to share our pieces with the public as well as other artists. 
                Many artists within Whangarei have had similar ideas surrounding the restoration and recycling of old materials. 
                This has led to much inspiration and growth for us. 
                Our last exhibition was the ArtBeat 2023 Exhibition, an amazing event that we were so proud to be a part of.
