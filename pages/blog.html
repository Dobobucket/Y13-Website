                Our build process is all about collaboration. Rebecca Maunder makes all of the designs using her skills as a graphic designer and as a talented artist. 
                These designs are then printed out as references for Brent Kallu to put together. 
                Brent is a qualified jeweller who has been working with his hands on all sorts of projects for many years. 
                Through this collaboration, we are able to put together all of the pieces displayed on this site, and we hope you love them as much as we do.

                The build process differs greatly between pieces, and we are always finding new techniques to overcome the challenges we face. 
                The coin fish were the first art pieces we made; this was inspired by our love for the Moana and an appreciation for the beautiful fauna that live down there. 
                Techniques such as soldering and brazing have been incredibly important for working with copper. As well as the recycled copper we use in our art, the wooden aspects all come from pieces of driftwood that we find at Whananaki, Northland.
                The native wood links back to our goal of evoking the amazing scenery we have in Aotearoa.
