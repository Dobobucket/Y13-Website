                    <p>We are a husband-and-wife duo with a vested interest in the upcycling of unused and discarded materials. From these, we create rustic art pieces that mimic the environment around us in beautiful Aotearoa.</p></div>
                <br>
                <div>
                    <p>All of the material in our art is, in some way, living its second life. Seeking out discontinued coinage and old copper sheets is what started us on this track with our copper fish. As we progressed and started drawing more inspiration from the land around us, we began to use more unique kinds of materials. The recycling of material that would otherwise go unused is a core piece of our artwork; we use it to show our love and appreciation for the world and the environment we live in.</p></div>

                <div>
                    <p>The Kiwi art scene is something that we are keen on getting involved with. We have already participated in several exhibitions that have allowed us to make connections with many other talented Kiwis. We hope to be able to stand out from the crowd through our pieces and vision. Take a look through our gallery of previous works, and we hope you love them as much as we do.</p></div>
